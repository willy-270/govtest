1. Introducing legislation
2. Committee assignment

## 2. Where are the typical places the bill may fail?
- Not enough votes in either the House or Senate during debate, and when the president chooses to sign the bill or not

## 3. The president has three options when a bill reaches his desk: Pass bill, veto bill, and pocket veto the bill. Be able to explain what each option is.
- Pass
    - The President signs the bill into law

- Veto
    - A veto rejects the bill

- Pocket veto
    - A pocket veto occurs when the present doesn't take action on the bill and lets it expire. It's a way to reject the bill quietly

- A veto can be overridden by a 2/3 vote in both the House and Senate
