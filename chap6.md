# Chapter 6

## 1. What does impeaching the president mean? In the process of impeaching the president, what roles do the Senate and House of Representatives play?
- Impeachment is to formally accuse the president of having committed a crime. It is initiated in the house, where a majority vote is required to impeach the president. Then, the case moves to the Senate for a trial. To convict and remove the president from office, a 2/3 vote is required.

## 2. What are the four sources of tension between Congress and the president? Be able to understand what each tension is and how it may potentially be an issue between Congress and the president.
1. Checks & balances
    - The legislative and executive branch can overpower each other in many ways. For example the president can veto laws passed by congress, and congress can override presidential vetoes.

2. Different constituents
    - Members of congress attempt to serve the needs of their own state/district, while the president tries to serve the needs of the entire nations, which can lead to conflicts.

3. Party politics
    - Party politics is when a member of some party will only ever vote with the rest of their party. When majority of congress is of the opposing party of the president, there tends to be a lot of conflict and very few things get passed.

4. Political timetables
    - The president's term is 4 years, while House members serve 2 and senators serve 6. This difference can lead to conflicts in priorities, for example, House members may focus on more short-term issues to appeal to voters for reelection, while the president may prioritize more long-term goals.
