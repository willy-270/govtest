# Chapter 9

The president is commander and chief of the armed forces. This role was not explained in much detail in the Constitution: 

## 1. Explain how presidents have argued that they have full authority in this matter even though it was not explicitly explained in the Constitution. 
- The scope of the commander and chief role is defined quite vaguely in the constitution. This has led to presidents arguing they have all powers needed to defend the nation as long as they do not interfere with other branches or violate law. Presidents will also point to previous precedent to justify being able to take certain actions.

## 2. What actual powers do they have and explain how they can use this power. 
- Powers the president actually has includes:
    - Military operations and strategy
    - War powers act
    - Shadow wars
    - Anything else that congress grants to the president

These powers are typically used during emergencies and wars.

## 3. Provide examples of how presidents have used their powers to pass laws during war times.
- George Bush got the Patriot Act passed after 9/11, which expanded power to fight terrorism
- Franklin D. Roosevelt was able to control prices, ration gas and food, and manage industries to produce war materials
- Lyndon Johnson deployed forces to Vietnam without an official declaration of war
